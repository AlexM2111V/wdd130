        <h2>Lima, Perú</h2>
        <img src="images/lima.webp" alt="Lima-Peru">
        <p>Lima was founded in 1535 as the Ciudad de los Reyes, Spanish for "City of
            Kings"), is the capital and largest city of Peru. It is located in the valleys of the Chillón, Rímac and
            Lurín Rivers, in the desert zone of the central coastal part of the country, overlooking the Pacific Ocean.
            The city is considered the political, cultural, financial and commercial center of Peru. Due to its
            geostrategic importance, the Globalization and World Cities Research Network has categorized it as a "beta"
            tier city. Jurisdictionally, the metropolis extends mainly within the province of Lima and in a smaller
            portion, to the west, within the Constitutional Province of Callao, where the seaport and the Jorge Chávez
            Airport are located. Both provinces have regional autonomy since 2002.</p>
